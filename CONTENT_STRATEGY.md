# MiroMiro Content Strategy 🚀

## Pain Points to Address

### Primary Pain Point
**"CSS extraction is self-taught and difficult"**
- No formal education exists for reverse-engineering websites
- Designers/developers waste hours manually deconstructing sites
- Right-clicking and inspecting is tedious and slow

### Competitor Analysis: CSS Scan
- **Their strength**: CSS-only extraction, $100k+ revenue
- **Our advantage**: Complete design toolkit (CSS + Assets + Design System Extraction)
- **Positioning**: "Like CSS Scan, but for your entire design workflow"

**LinkedIn Posts:**
- Long-form story: "How I wasted 40+ hours learning to deconstruct websites (and how you can skip that)"
- Poll: "How do you currently extract design elements from websites? A) View source manually B) Browser dev tools C) Screenshot + eyeball it D) Dedicated tool"
